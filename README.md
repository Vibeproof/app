### Flow

1. Create your event page (the cover image can be AI generated)  
2. Gate the event applications to specific group(s) of users 
3. Request a zk proof of group membership from the attendees
4. Accept the applications and share your event details (physical address/link)



### How it works

* 🌐 IPFS: All events and related data are stored on IPFS (inspired by Snapshot), ensuring transparency and durability. 
* 🎭 [Sismo Connect](https://www.sismo.io/) is used as an SSO, enabling requests and verification of zk proofs from users.  
* 🔐 End-to-end encryption for all private messages and applications, viewable only by event organizers.



### Examples 

- Private meetup for specific NFT holders. Wallets of the attendees remain private; event details are shared only with accepted participants. 
- Community call for DAO participants and Snapshot voters.
- Youtube premier gated to your lens subscribers.
